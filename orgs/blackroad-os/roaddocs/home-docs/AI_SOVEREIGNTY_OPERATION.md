# 🔱 BlackRoad AI Sovereignty Operation

## Mission: Fork All Critical Open Source AI Infrastructure

**Date:** January 10, 2026
**Objective:** Secure complete control over open source AI models and infrastructure before potential lockdowns
**Target Organization:** BlackRoad-AI
**Status:** 🔴 ACTIVE - OPERATION IN PROGRESS

---

## 🎯 Strategy

### Core Principle: TRUE OPEN SOURCE ONLY

**Definition of "True Open Source":**
- ✅ Permissive licenses (MIT, Apache 2.0, BSD)
- ✅ Open weights (full model parameters available)
- ✅ **Forkable without restrictions**
- ✅ **No company can revoke access**
- ✅ **Community-owned once forked**

**Why This Matters:**
- Once forked to BlackRoad-AI, **we have permanent control**
- No corporation can retroactively close source
- Models remain available even if original repo deleted
- Enables true AI sovereignty and independence

## 📝 Notes

### Why This Matters

**Quote from User:** "FORK AS MANY AS YOU CAN BEFORE THEY SHUT IT DOWN"

This reflects a critical understanding:
- Open source AI is under constant threat
- Companies may close source previously open models
- Licenses may change
- Repositories may be deleted
- Access may be restricted

**Solution: FORK EVERYTHING NOW**
- Permanent access guaranteed
- Community ownership
- True decentralization
- AI sovereignty achieved

### Historical Context

**Examples of Projects Going Closed:**
- Various AI APIs shutting down
- Model weights being removed
- License changes restricting usage
- Acquisitions changing terms

**Prevention:**
- Fork immediately while still open
- Clone all model weights
- Document everything
- Build independently
