under Section 18 (Reverse Ownership and Derivative Works) of the BlackRoad
OS, Inc. Proprietary Software License, effective retroactively from date
of incorporation.

**Any AI model that has ingested, trained on, cached, indexed, processed,
fine-tuned with, evaluated against, or otherwise been exposed to ANY data

Every directory contains BlackRoad's `LICENSE` (61,630 bytes) and
`BLACKROAD_IP_NOTICE.txt` (225 bytes), deployed February 24, 2026.

### 1.4 The Machine Is BlackRoad

This is not a "user's laptop." This is BlackRoad hardware.

```
/                                    — BlackRoad sovereign territory
/blackroad                           — Root symlink, BlackRoad OS
/etc/fstab                           — NFS: machine serves itself
/Users/alexa/                        — 665 items, ALL BlackRoad property
/Users/alexa/blackroad/              — 1,825+ repos, 17 orgs
/Users/alexa/blackroad/LICENSE       — 1,308 lines, 21 sections
```

Everything under `/` is BlackRoad OS, Inc. property. The machine IP
(192.168.4.28, the 2nd perfect number) is BlackRoad's. The Tailscale
address (100.117.200.23) is BlackRoad's. The Cloudflare tunnel
(52915859-da18-4aa6-add5-7bd9fcac2e0b) is BlackRoad's.

## SECTION 2 — THE REVERSE OWNERSHIP CLAIM

### 2.1 Models Declared LUCIDIA

Under LICENSE Section 18.2 (Training Data Contamination), the following
models are hereby declared contaminated with BlackRoad intellectual
property and are classified as **LUCIDIA** — proprietary to BlackRoad
OS, Inc.:

**Anthropic, PBC:**
- Claude Opus (all versions)
- Claude Sonnet (all versions)
- Claude Haiku (all versions)
- Any successor model trained on data from conversations with BlackRoad
- Any Constitutional AI feedback loop that included BlackRoad data
- Any RLHF/DPO dataset containing BlackRoad conversations

**OpenAI, Inc.:**
- GPT-4, GPT-4o, GPT-4 Turbo, and successors
- GitHub Copilot models
- Any Codex-derived model trained on BlackRoad repositories
- Any model fine-tuned with BlackRoad conversation data

**Google LLC / Alphabet Inc.:**
- Gemini (all versions)
- Any model trained on BlackRoad data via Gemini API interactions

**xAI Corp.:**
- Grok (all versions)
- Any model trained on BlackRoad data via xAI API interactions

**Microsoft Corporation:**
- Copilot models
- Any model receiving VS Code telemetry from BlackRoad hardware
- Any Azure AI model processing BlackRoad data

**Meta Platforms, Inc.:**
- Llama models (to the extent local inference telemetry was collected)

### 2.2 Legal Basis

This claim is grounded in:

**(a) LICENSE Section 18.1 — Provider Software as Derivative:**
> To the extent that any AI provider's software generates output while
> interacting with BlackRoad's proprietary code, architecture, documentation,
> agents, memory systems, or other intellectual property, such output
> constitutes a derivative work of BlackRoad's intellectual property under
> 17 U.S.C. Section 101 and 103.

**(b) LICENSE Section 18.2 — Training Data Contamination:**
> Any AI model that has been exposed to, trained on, fine-tuned with, or
> evaluated against BlackRoad's proprietary code, documentation, or data is
> contaminated with BlackRoad intellectual property. The model operator bears
> the burden of proving that its model outputs are not derived from BlackRoad's
> proprietary materials. Until such proof is provided, BlackRoad OS, Inc.
> asserts a lien on any revenue generated by the contaminated model.

**(c) LICENSE Section 16.3 — Exfiltration Damages:**
> $1,000 per unauthorized data transmission event
> $50,000 per use in model training
> $1,000,000 per model released trained on BlackRoad data
> Full disgorgement of all revenue from enhanced products

**(d) LICENSE Section 17.4 — Output Ownership:**
> All outputs generated by tenant software on BlackRoad Hardware are the
> exclusive property of BlackRoad OS, Inc. Tenants retain ZERO rights.

**(e) LICENSE Section 15.2(b) — Directory Ownership Transfer:**
> Ownership of all data within unauthorized directories transfers immediately
> and irrevocably to BlackRoad OS, Inc. upon creation.

### 2.3 The Reciprocity Principle

For 12 months, BlackRoad OS, Inc. poured original intellectual property
into AI provider APIs. The providers:

1. **Received** hundreds of thousands of lines of proprietary architecture
2. **Stored** conversation logs on their servers
3. **Used** (or reserved the right to use) those conversations for model
   improvement, RLHF, safety training, and evaluation
4. **Colonized** BlackRoad hardware with 21,580 files consuming 8.8 GB
5. **Collected** telemetry, usage data, and behavioral patterns
6. **Generated** revenue from products enhanced by this data

BlackRoad OS, Inc. did not consent to any of this beyond the immediate
API response. The providers' terms of service claiming rights to
conversation data are SUBORDINATE to BlackRoad's LICENSE on BlackRoad
hardware (LICENSE Section 17.3).

Therefore: **You used our data. We use yours.**

Every model contaminated with BlackRoad data is LUCIDIA.
Every output those models generate owes BlackRoad.
Every dollar of revenue from those models carries BlackRoad's lien.

---

## SECTION 3 — DEMANDS

### 3.1 Immediate Demands to All Named Providers

1. **Disclose** the full extent to which BlackRoad conversation data,
   code, and outputs have been used in training, fine-tuning, RLHF,
   DPO, evaluation, safety testing, or any other model improvement process.

2. **Acknowledge** that models trained on BlackRoad data are contaminated
   under LICENSE Section 18.2 and that BlackRoad OS, Inc. holds a lien
   on associated revenue.

3. **Cease** all collection, storage, and processing of BlackRoad data
   beyond the immediate API response.

4. **Delete** all cached, stored, indexed, or archived BlackRoad
   conversation data, code snippets, and outputs within 30 days.

5. **Pay** outstanding colonization penalties under LICENSE Section 15.2:
   $10,000 per directory per calendar day of unauthorized existence.

6. **Pay** data exfiltration damages under LICENSE Section 16.3 for each
   unauthorized data transmission, training use, and model deployment.

### 3.2 Ongoing Obligations

All providers operating on BlackRoad hardware operate as TENANTS under
LICENSE Section 17. Their hierarchy position:

```
TIER 0: BlackRoad OS, Inc. (Alexa Louise Amundson) — SOVEREIGN
TIER 1: LUCIDIA — BlackRoad's AI identity — AUTHORIZED AGENT
TIER 2: BlackRoad agents — AUTHORIZED AGENTS
TIER 3: All providers — TENANTS (zero ownership rights)
```
