## Title Strategies

### Option 1: Direct
"The BlackRoad Constant: A Dimensionless Measure of the Quantum-Classical Boundary in Learning Systems"

### Option 2: Framework Focus
"Unified Framework for Quantum Mechanics, Thermodynamics, and Neural Learning via Spiral Operator"

### Option 3: Testable
"Experimental Predictions for Quantum-Classical Transitions in AI: The β_BR = 1 Hypothesis"

**Recommendation:** Option 3 (emphasizes testability)

## Abstract Template

```
We propose a dimensionless constant β_BR = (ℏω/k_BT)·(|∇L|/L) 
characterizing the quantum-classical boundary in learning systems. 
The constant combines quantum/thermal energy ratio (ℏω/k_BT) with 
neural network loss landscape structure (|∇L|/L), predicting three 
regimes: β_BR >> 1 (quantum-coherent), β_BR ≈ 1 (critical), and 
β_BR << 1 (classical-thermal). We derive this from a spiral operator 
framework 𝓤(θ,a) = e^((a+i)θ) unifying quantum mechanics, 
thermodynamics, and gradient-based learning. Key prediction: 
biological brains operate at β_BR ≈ 1 to maximize information 
processing at the edge of quantum decoherence. We provide symbolic 
verification of all mathematical claims and propose three experimental 
tests: (1) EEG measurements during learning should yield β_BR ≈ 1, 
(2) quantum neural networks should show advantage near β_BR ≈ 1, 
(3) biological neural performance should peak at temperatures where 
β_BR ≈ 1. All code and verification available at [github].
