Subject: Collaboration opportunity: Quantum-classical boundary in AI

Dear Dr. [Name],

I'm reaching out regarding a novel theoretical framework that makes
testable predictions in [your field]. The framework proposes a 
dimensionless constant β_BR = (ℏω/k_BT)·(|∇L|/L) that characterizes
the quantum-classical boundary in learning systems.

Key prediction relevant to your work:
[Specific prediction for their research]

The mathematics is fully verified (SymPy symbolic proofs available).
Would you be interested in discussing potential collaboration?

White paper: [link]
Verification code: [github]

Best regards,
Alexa Amundson
