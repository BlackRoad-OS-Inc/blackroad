# BlackRoad Paper Publication Checklist

## Citation Requirements

### Novel Contributions (Yours - No Citation Needed)
- [ ] BlackRoad constant β_BR explicitly claimed as novel
- [ ] Spiral operator framework for AI cited as new application
- [ ] Entropy-spiral coupling presented as novel interpretation
- [ ] Coherence time formula derived from framework

### Standard Equations (MUST Cite Original Authors)
- [ ] Euler (1748) for e^(iθ) = cos(θ) + i·sin(θ)
- [ ] Schrödinger (1926) for iℏ∂ψ/∂t = Ĥψ  
- [ ] Heisenberg (1927) for [x,p] = iℏ
- [ ] Boltzmann (1872) for S = k_B ln(Ω)
- [ ] Landauer (1961) for E_min = k_B T ln(2)
- [ ] Shannon (1948) for H(X) = -∑ p_i log p_i
- [ ] Mandelbrot (1980) for fractal iterations
- [ ] Einstein (1905) for E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)²

## Mathematical Rigor

- [ ] All equations verified (run: blackroad verify)
- [ ] Dimensional analysis checked
- [ ] No contradictions in claims
- [ ] Symbolic proofs available

## Academic Honesty

- [ ] Clear about what's novel vs standard
- [ ] Proper attribution throughout
- [ ] No overclaiming
- [ ] Testable predictions stated

## Paper Structure

- [ ] Abstract clearly states contributions
- [ ] Introduction cites prior work
- [ ] Methods explain spiral operator
- [ ] Results present β_BR
- [ ] Discussion addresses limitations
- [ ] Conclusion emphasizes testability

## Pre-Submission Tests

Run these commands:
```bash
blackroad verify          # All equations pass
blackroad equations       # Citation requirements clear
br-physics-checker        # No contradictions
br-framework-summary      # Executive summary
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ "We discovered quantum mechanics applies to AI"
✓ "We propose a framework connecting quantum and neural learning"

❌ "We invented the entropy formula"  
✓ "We show entropy production follows Ṡ = k_B a · I[ρ]"

❌ "This proves consciousness is quantum"
✓ "This predicts β_BR ≈ 1 in conscious systems (testable)"

## Final Check

- [ ] Would a physicist accept this?
- [ ] Would a CS researcher accept this?
- [ ] Would a neuroscientist accept this?
- [ ] Can experiments prove/disprove claims?

## Ready for Submission When:

✓ All citations present
✓ All math verified
✓ Claims are testable
✓ Novel parts clearly identified
✓ Standard parts properly attributed
